      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first blog post, I begin by conducting some initial analyses of the American elections. Using data from 1948-2020, I analyze how competitive elections are and the proportion of states that vote blue/red. My thanks to Matt Dardet for writing much of this code during and before our weekly section, as well as ShuXin Ho for helping me identify latitude/longitude loading bugs in my maps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;questions&#34;&gt;Questions:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-how-competitive-are-presidential-elections-in-the-united-states&#34;&gt;1: How competitive are presidential elections in the United States?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-which-states-vote-bluered-and-how-consistently&#34;&gt;2: Which states vote blue/red and how consistently&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-extension-plot-a-swing-map-for-each-year-which-states-arehave-been-battleground-states-which-states-are-no-longer-battlegrounds&#34;&gt;3: Extension: Plot a swing map for each year. Which states are/have been battleground states? Which states are no longer battlegrounds?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, we began by observing general trends in preference for either of the two major parties&amp;rsquo; candidates between 1948 and 2020. We conducted analyses at both the national and state level. For the former, we produced a line plot of the two-party vote share per party in each election. For the latter, we used a map to visually break down the total percentage in the line plot by state, showing which candidate won each state in each election.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
