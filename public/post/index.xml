      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s post, we focus on analyzing polling data, attempting to understand how they can best predict election outcomes. My thanks again to Matthew Dardet for his generous starter code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this analysis, we looked at polling data from the 2020 election (sourced from FiveThirtyEight). While election forecasting might benefit from more data, we reference 2020 here for simplicity. We began by visualizing the available data, helping us understand existing patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 2: Elections and the Economy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we focus on understanding how well the status of the economy predicts the outcome of an election. In particular, we aim to quantify this uncertainty. My thanks again to Matt Dardet for his generous starter code in section, much of which I have used/adapted here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, we explored how well the economy &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt; with election outcomes by computing the bivariate correlation between quarterly GDP growth and incumbent two-party vote share. We began by reviewing a scatterplot of this data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 1 - Initial Analyses</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/09/07/week-1-initial-analyses/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first blog post, I conduct some initial analyses of historical American presidential elections. Using &lt;em&gt;popular vote data from 1948-2020 (provided by the course)&lt;/em&gt;, I analyze how competitive elections are and the proportion of states that vote blue/red. My thanks to Matt Dardet for writing much of this code during and before our weekly section, as well as ShuXin Ho for helping me identify latitude/longitude loading bugs in my maps when we were initially building them in section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
