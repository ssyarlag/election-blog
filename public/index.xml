      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first blog post, I conduct some initial analyses of historical American presidential elections. Using data from 1948-2020, I analyze how competitive elections are and the proportion of states that vote blue/red. My thanks to Matt Dardet for writing much of this code during and before our weekly section, as well as ShuXin Ho for helping me identify latitude/longitude loading bugs in my maps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer this week&amp;rsquo;s questions, which focus on electoral competitiveness and historical voting patterns, we began by observing general trends in preference for either of the two major parties&amp;rsquo; candidates between 1948 and 2020. We conducted analyses at both the national and state level. For the former, we produced a line plot of the two-party vote share per party in each election. For the latter, we used a map to visually break down the total percentage in the line plot by state, showing which candidate won each state in each election.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMin&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
