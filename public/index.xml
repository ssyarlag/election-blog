      <title>Post-Election Campaign Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;draft-1&#34;&gt;Draft 1&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my final blog post, I analyze the Trump and Harris 2024 Presidential campaigns in the state of Michigan, one of the seven swing states that were said to have driven the outcome of the election (1).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-michigan-overview&#34;&gt;1) Michigan Overview&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geography and Electoral History&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Located in the American Midwest, among a group of states that have been termed as the Rust Belt due to their historical affiliation with American manufacturing, Michigan was identified relatively early in the election cycle as a state to watch (2). The state has historically been referred to as part of the &amp;ldquo;Blue Wall,&amp;rdquo; a grouping that also includes other swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin &amp;ndash; referencing their history of voting for Democratic presidential candidates, at least until the Trump&amp;rsquo;s election to the presidency in 2016 (3). Although the Democratic party had achieved significant electoral success in the state in recent years, with both Senators, a &amp;ldquo;popular&amp;rdquo; governor being Democrats, and control of both state legislatures, as well as the the state passing a ballot measure protecting abortion access, the state&amp;rsquo;s Republican party also appeared poised to make electoral progress in the election (4).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Post-Election Reflection</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/11/07/post-election-reflection/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On November 6, 2024, the day after election day, several major news outlets confirmed that Donald Trump was elected as the next president of the United States (1). In light of this news, this blog reflects on the election prediction model that I made in the weeks leading up to the election, attempting to evaluate why I predicted the opposite outcome and what could be done to contribute to better modeling in future elections.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Final Prediction</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/10/30/final-prediction/</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/post/2024/10/30/final-prediction/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For my final weekly blog post, I produced my final prediction model for the 2024 US Presidential Election.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;methodological-note&#34;&gt;Methodological Note&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each of the models that I have developed over the past few weeks have predicted a strong performance for Vice President Harris in all seven predicted &amp;ldquo;swing&amp;rdquo; states (4) . While this does not necessarily align with what some major forecasters predict for the election (4), it is unclear how to evaluate the performance of these models without relying on this benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As I did last week, I will continue to compare two models, one using data from after 1984 and the other using data from after 1996.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 6 - Campaign Ads</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/10/09/week-6-campaign-ads/</link>

My thanks as always to Matthew Dardet for his generous starter code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I start by including some visualizations, originally put together by Matt, to help better understand advertising trends.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://example.org/post/2024/10/09/week-6-campaign-ads/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png&#34; width=&#34;672&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It appears that economic themes, including employment, budget, and taxes, are common themes in ads nationwide, potentially suggesting that campaigns believe that information related to the economy is a key topic in the minds of many voters and therefore must be addressed. I was interested, though, in seeing trends in social media ads in more recent elections. Using Facebook data from the most recent presidential election, subsetted to only include advertisements directly launched by the Biden or Trump campaigns, I produced a visualization that compared the number of ads launched, the amount of spending, and polling support over time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Can demographics and turnout be used to predict election outcomes? If so, how and how well?&amp;rdquo; Thank you, as always, to Matthew Dardet for his starter code and coding assistance. I also thank Jacqui Schlesinger, my partner for this week&amp;rsquo;s in-class presentation, for her valuable thoughts and advice on interesting visualizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 4: Incumbency</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/09/25/week-4-incumbency/</link>

More specifically, we ask &amp;ldquo;How should we treat the incumbency advantage in our 2024 electoral forecasts?&amp;rdquo;. As always, my thanks to Matthew Dardet for his helpful starter code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This week, we reviewed a canonically successful model used to predict the advantage of incumbency: the Time for Change Model (TFC) by Alan Abramowitz. This relatively simple model &amp;ndash; an OLS regression with independent variables of Quarter 2 GDP Growth, June Gallup poll approval, and whether or not one is an incumbent &amp;ndash; is modeled here. We exclude 2020 data here, given that (as we have shown in previous blogs) the year is an outlier in terms of GDP growth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 3 - Polling</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s post, we focus on analyzing polling data. Our research question is &amp;ldquo;How can we best use polls to predict election outcomes?&amp;rdquo;. My thanks again to Matthew Dardet for his generous starter code.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this analysis, we focus on polling data from FiveThirtyEight. We began by visualizing the available data from the past several presidential elections to help understand how polls changes relative to the actual election outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 2: Elections and the Economy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s lab, we focus on understanding how well the status of the economy predicts the outcome of an election. In particular, we aim to quantify this uncertainty. My thanks again to Matt Dardet for his generous starter code in section, much of which I have used/adapted here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, we explored how well the economy &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt; with election outcomes by computing the bivariate correlation between quarterly GDP growth and incumbent two-party vote share. We began by reviewing a scatterplot of this data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Week 1 - Initial Analyses</title>
      <link>https://example.org/post/2024/09/07/week-1-initial-analyses/</link>

      <guid>https://example.org/post/2024/09/07/week-1-initial-analyses/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first blog post, I conduct some initial analyses of historical American presidential elections. Using &lt;em&gt;popular vote data from 1948-2020 (provided by the course)&lt;/em&gt;, I analyze how competitive elections are and the proportion of states that vote blue/red. My thanks to Matt Dardet for writing much of this code during and before our weekly section, as well as ShuXin Ho for helping me identify latitude/longitude loading bugs in my maps when we were initially building them in section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
